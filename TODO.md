# TODO for API integration and request.js implementation

- [x] Read and understand existing bot.py for Roblox ban system.
- [x] Read existing request.js (empty or missing content).
- [x] Create request.js as an Express API server with:
  - POST /ban endpoint to ban users on Roblox.
  - GET /banlist endpoint to retrieve Roblox ban list.
- [x] Modify bot.py to use local API server for Roblox ban operations:
  - roblox_ban_user calls POST /ban on API server.
  - get_roblox_ban_list calls GET /banlist on API server.
- [x] Create package.json for request.js dependencies and scripts.
- [ ] User to install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] User to run API server: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
- [ ] User to set environment variable `API_SERVER_URL` to point to the API server URL (default http://localhost:3000).
- [ ] Test ban commands on Discord for Roblox platform to verify API communication.
- [ ] Optionally extend request.js to support Discord ban APIs if needed.
- [ ] Document usage and setup instructions in README.md or separate docs.

Next steps:
- User to install Node.js dependencies and run the API server.
- User to test the integration end-to-end.
